# Postfix

Postfix++ Python program

Postfix++ is a stack-based computer language directed at the evaluation of arithmetic
expressions.

Operators, in postfix arithmetical expressions, follow operands. For example, 3 4 + means 3 + 4.

The ‘++’ refers to an enhanced form of postfix: a postfix with variables. Expressions can contain
variable names; the value of the variable is used for the calculation. The assignment operator ‘=’
assigns a value to a variable.

For example A 3 =
will set the value of A to 3. It is equivalent to the infix assignment statement A = 3 that is to be
found in many computer languages.
